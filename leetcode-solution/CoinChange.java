    * To calculate the dp[i], I am finding the amount j which j + coinAmount = i;
    * if dp[j] has been calculated before, we knew that dp[i] = dp[j] + 1;
    * And because we have different coins of denominations, we need to keep the smallest number of dp[i] for each calculation
    * For those i cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, we assign the dp[i] with the max value of Integer.
    *
    * Time Complexity: O(S*n). On each step the algorithm finds the next dp[i] in n iteration, where 1 <= i <= S.
    * Therefore in total the iterations are S * n;
    * Space complexity: O(S). We use extra space for the memorization table.
